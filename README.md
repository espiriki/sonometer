Run sonometro.m on matlab and pass as the argument the signal to be analised

Ex:
>>sonometro('sign_to_be_analised.wav');


It will be printed on Matlab console the LEQ value of the signal that is going to be analysed

Matlab will open 8 figures:

Figure 1 - Time plot of the signal

Figure 2 - Spectrum plot of the signal

Figure 3 - A-curve plot

Figure 4 - Signal plot before and after the A-weighting

Figure 5 - Energy plot of the A-weighted signal

Figure 6 - Energy plot of the A-weighted signal in dB scale

Figure 7 - LAS plot

Figure 8 - Third octave signal plot
